<h4>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4>
<p><cite> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for
  all individuals within the European Union. <br/> The GDPR aims primarily to give control back to citizens and
  residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by
  unifying the regulation within the EU. <br/> When the GDPR takes effect, it will replace the 1995 Data Protection
  Directive. <br/> It was adopted on 27th, April 2016 and it becomes enforceable from 25 May 2018, after a two-year
  transition period. </cite> <br/> <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679"

<h4>Business Data</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Landscape Overview</li>
  <li>Instant and Total Consumption</li>
  <li>Charging Stations' Status</li>
  <li>Charging Curves</li>
  <li>Session Date/Hour and Duration</li>
  <li>Sessions History</li>
  <li>Active Sessions</li>

</ul>

<h4>Scenarios</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Statistics on Usage, Consumption and Cost</li>
  <li>Site Management</li>
  <li>Price Management</li>
  <li>Smart Charging</li>
  <li>Charging Station Booking</li>

</ul>

<h4>Goal of the Data Processing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Maximize the usage of the charging stations by the user while keeping the cost low.</li>
  <li>Improve the maintenance of charging stations.</li>
  <li>Develop a charging optimization algorithm to introduce a load management system that enables EVs to charge
    concurrently according site's constraints (site's maximum power...)
  </li>
  <li>Encourage users to charge at home and eventually get their electricity consumptions refunded for charging their
    professional cars
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Privacy by Design</h4>
<p>This application has been designed considering all personal data privacy from the beginning.</p>

<h4>Involved Users</h4>
<p>The users that make use of the charging stations on the monitored site and who registered to the <a
  href="{{chargeAngelsURL}}"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charge-Angels</a> application.</p>

<h4>Data Processing Target</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The data processing are for local Site Managers, Data Scientists or Demos to internal/external customers.</li>
  <li>Users access the data only through the secured HTTPs <a href="{{chargeAngelsURL}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charge-Angels</a>
    application.
  </li>
  <li>SAP Data Scientists receive only the anonymized transactions from an admin to test their charging algorithms.</li>
  <li>For demoing the <a href="{{chargeAngelsURL}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charge-Angels</a> application to
    external people (not SAP), we use a demo user to anonymize all the personal data.
  </li>
  <li>User's sessions linked to Charge at Home scenario will be pushed to Cloud Revenue systems in Germany for testing
    and trial purposes.
  </li>
  <li>User's sessions could be processed to predict charging demand on a given site.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Localization</h4>
<p>The data will be stored on a server in the SAP Cloud Foundry platform that will be physically installed in a country
  belonging to the European Union. <br/>
  Today, our SAP Cloud server is hosted in Germany in Frankfurt.</p>

<h4>Right to Oblivion</h4>
<p>Your personal data will be kept until the end of the user's contract with the company.<br/>
  Your personal data will be deleted by an administrator after a period of 6 months of inactivity
  (no transaction has been done during this period.) <br/>
  In that case, your user's profile will be deleted and all your sessions will be anonymized thus no
  relations can be done anymore with you.</p>

<h4>Security by Default</h4>
<p>Credentials are required to access the application for all the administrators, standard and demos users. <br/>
  The data is sent over the network using an encrypted protocol ensuring their confidentiality. <br/>
  Only administrators are authorized to read, write, edit, delete all the data stored in the server. <br/>
  Standard users are only authorized to read and edit their own personal data, see the charging stations availability,
  the current charge,
  the history of their sessions and their statistics. <br/> Your data can be communicated to third parties in case of
  legal inquiry such as "Inspection du travail" or "Services fiscaux" or police services.</p>

<h4>User Consent</h4>
<p>You must give your explicit consent for us to use your data. <br/> This is done via a checkbox in the log in page
  of the <a href="{{chargeAngelsURL}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charge-Angels</a> application.</p>
